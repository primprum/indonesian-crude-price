# Indonesian Crude Price (ICP)

<br>

**Indonesian Crude Price (ICP)** is a price index for crude oil from Indonesia.

It's not a single price, but rather an average based on eight different Indonesian crudes, including Cinta, Duri, and Minas.

Essentially, it's a weighted average considering the production volume and quality of each oil field.

### Individual Field Prices

While the ICP gives a general idea of Indonesian crude oil price, each specific field can have its own price based on several factors:

- **API gravity**

  This measures how "heavy" the oil is.

  > Lighter oils, like Minas, are easier to refine and fetch higher prices. Cinta and Duri are heavier oils, commanding lower prices.

- **Sulfur content**

  Higher sulfur content requires additional processing, impacting the price.

- **Production costs**

  Each field has its own unique geological challenges and extraction methods, influencing its cost.

- **Market demand**

  Specific refineries might have preferences for certain crude types, affecting their market value.

So, the prices we saw on oilprice.com for Cinta, Duri, and Minas represent the **individual selling prices** of crude oil from those specific fields.

They might differ from the ICP due to the factors mentioned above.

Here are some additional points to remember:

- The ICP is used in long-term contracts for Indonesian crude oil exports.
- Individual field prices are typically used for spot market sales or short-term contracts.
- Prices for all crudes, including Indonesian ones, fluctuate based on global market dynamics.
